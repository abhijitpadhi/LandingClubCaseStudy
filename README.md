## General Information
- The company is a largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss. 
- Analysis of data set using EDA.
- Business probem: Risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    1) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    2) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- The data set with name "laon" is used.

## Conclusions
- As the interest rate is increasing the probability that person will default is increasing with   highest of 16% & above.
- Borrowers with more than 10+ years of employment length having “debt_consolidation” purpose are more Charged Off.
- Loans with less instalments are having maximum charged off.
- With increase in income 'dti' is decreasing. Thus  higher loan amount can be sanctioned.
